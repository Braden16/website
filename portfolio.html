    <h1> 1.1.9 pltw project
    <br>
    <h1> This is our first project from PLTW Lesson 1.1.9. The ice cream stand is on the bottom of the screen including images of the 2 different flavors and a drawing of cherries on the side. It tells the user the 2 scoops we have available (Minion Fever and Banana Swirl) and that each scoop is 2 dollars and a cherry will cost an extra dollar. The program asks the user for their name, what flavor they want (flavor 1 or 2),
	    how many scoops, and whether they want a cherry or not. If they user chooses a flavor other than #1 or 2, the program will continue to run until they pick correctly. They can add as many scoops as they want and no matter how high the last scoop is, a cherry will be added on top if they would like. Finally, the program calculates the total of the ice cream based on their scoops and additional cherry.
